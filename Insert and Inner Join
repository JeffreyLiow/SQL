1) A new animal has come in, with the following details:
name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1
Add him to the Animals table.
2) You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zooâ€™s visitors. 
Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, sorted by countries.

Recall INSERT and INNER JOIN keywords.

SELECT animals.name, animals.type, countries.country FROM animals, countries
WHERE animals.country_id=countries.id order by animals.country_id desc
